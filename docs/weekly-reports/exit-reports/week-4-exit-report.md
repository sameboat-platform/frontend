## Overview (Week 4 – Oct 6 – Oct 30)

Milestone focus: Auth store migration to Zustand with stable public API, visibility‑based session refresh, intendedPath polish, CI hardening, and release v0.3.0.

### Highlights

- Shipped release v0.3.0 (tagged) with CHANGELOG and compare links; milestone closed and post‑release triage completed.
- Migrated auth store from custom Context to Zustand while preserving the `useAuth()` public contract; introduced `AuthEffects` for bootstrap + visibility listeners.
- Implemented visibility‑driven session refresh with a 30s cooldown via pure helper `shouldRefreshOnVisibility`; replaced brittle integration test with deterministic unit tests.
- Preserved full `intendedPath` (pathname + search + hash) through login redirects; added tests and fixed edge cases.
- Standardized auth debug flags (`VITE_DEBUG_AUTH`, `VITE_DEBUG_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP`) and cleaned console noise; added a console hygiene test.
- CI: added dependency audit workflow (fails on High/Critical) and documented policy; added bundle analysis script and notes.

### What Went Well

- Store migration landed without breaking changes—public `useAuth` remained stable; consumers required no edits.
- Visibility refresh logic is isolated, testable, and deterministic; fewer flakes and clearer logs gated by flags.
- Release preparation was smooth: CHANGELOG first, then version bump and tag; PR/CI stayed green.

### What We Struggled With

- Initial attempt at an integration test for visibility events proved flaky; resolved by extracting a pure helper and unit‑testing cooldown semantics.
- A few React Hooks lint violations in dev‑only debug components required refactoring (early return before any hooks, inner component pattern).

### Completed vs Planned

- Zustand migration + effects: Done.
- IntendedPath preservation and error mapping: Done.
- Visibility‑based refresh with cooldown: Done (unit‑tested).
- Console hygiene and test add‑ons: Done.
- CI dependency audit and docs: Done.
- Release 0.3.0: Done; tag pushed; milestone closed; next milestones opened.

Deferred / Next trains
- Post‑MVP end‑to‑end test for actual visibility + cooldown using a browser runner (Playwright).
- Minor UI polish (logout affordance surfacing, user summary tweaks) slated for 0.3.1/0.4.0 as needed.

### Notable PRs/Commits

- feat(auth): migrate context store → Zustand; add AuthEffects for bootstrap + visibility
- feat(auth): preserve intendedPath end‑to‑end; tests
- chore(ci): dependency audit workflow + docs
- chore(tooling): bundle analyzer script and docs; soft perf budget
- docs: RFC for Zustand store; README/architecture updates
- docs: CHANGELOG 0.3.0; release notes

### Metrics & Quality Gates

- Typecheck: PASS
- Lint: PASS (React Hooks clean; no unused disables)
- Tests: PASS (unit + RTL; deterministic visibility tests)
- Build: PASS (tsc -b && vite build)
- Security audit: 0 known vulnerabilities after npm audit fix

### Follow‑ups (queued for 0.3.1/0.4.0)

- Playwright E2E for visibility refresh cooldown
- Small UX polish on Me/UserSummary and debug toggles
- Optional: auto‑generated release notes via gh, fed by CHANGELOG sections

### Appendix

- Week 4 plan updated with "v0.3.0 shipped" status and links.
- Opened milestones: v0.3.1 (patches), v0.4.0 (next minor).

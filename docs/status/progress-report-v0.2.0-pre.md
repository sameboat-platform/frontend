# SameBoat Frontend Progress Report (Pre 0.2.1 / Post 0.2.0)

Date: 2025-10-08

## Executive Summary

Core platform foundations are in place: authenticated SPA shell, resilient health monitoring, automated release & coverage workflows, dependency audit gating, and bundle analysis with an initial soft performance budget. Focus now shifts to incremental performance improvements (code-splitting), expanded test breadth, and observability.

## Key Completed Items (since project bootstrap through v0.2.0 early clean-up)

### Architecture & Core Features
- Auth system with single guarded bootstrap (`/api/me`) to hydrate user context, avoiding duplicate StrictMode invocations.
- Protected routing layer (`ProtectedRoute`) respecting `bootstrapped` state before redirect decisions.
- Centralized health monitoring component (`HealthCheckCard`) with:
  - Stable interval polling and ref-based state tracking to prevent interval churn.
  - Pause-on-error (after consecutive failures) + manual Resume (immediate probe + interval restart).
  - Minimum skeleton display to reduce UI flicker.
- Runtime Debug Panel (dev-only) aggregating auth + health probe history (25 entries), copy helpers, reduced-motion respect.

### Tooling & Automation
- Release automation script (`scripts/release.mjs`):
  - Bumps SemVer (patch default; minor/major flags) and migrates `[Unreleased]` to dated section.
  - Updates diff links with v-prefixed tags (e.g., `v0.2.0`).
  - Guards: aborts if `[Unreleased]` empty; refuses to run unless on `main`.
  - Annotated tag creation (optional `--tag`).
- Coverage workflow:
  - PR coverage run with V8 provider; percentage written to PR job summary.
  - Badge updated only on pushes to `main`.
- Dependency Audit workflow:
  - Runs `npm audit --omit=dev`; fails on High/Critical; reports full severity counts in job summary.
  - Security policy + remediation playbook (overrides, patch-package, temporary allowlist w/ expiration, forward-fix strategy).
- Changelog enforcement script fails CI when source changes lack `[Unreleased]` entry.
- PR template with “Post‑merge actions” checklist (required checks, tag push, milestone triage).
- Bundle analysis pipeline (`npm run analyze`) creating stable `dist/bundle-stats.html` and auto-opening.

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README (auth lifecycle, tooling, scripts, performance budget).
- Architecture overview (flow, modules, extension points, CI & release guard).
- Security: dependency audit policy & resolution workflow.
- Automated release system doc (frontend process + backend adoption blueprint).
- Weekly plans & exit reports (Week 3 wrap and early Week 4 prep).

### Performance & Quality
- Soft performance budget introduced: initial JS (gzip) ≤ 250 kB (advisory; not yet enforced).
- Initial bundle currently ~200 kB gzip (core) + larger vendor chunk (~>200 kB) — analyzer identifies Chakra UI + framer-motion + React as primary weight; opportunities logged in TTD.
- Strict TypeScript build gating (`tsc -b` pre Vite build) prevents emitting on type errors.
- ESLint flat config (React, Hooks, a11y, import ordering) enforced in CI.
- Coverage baseline (≥50%) established; test suite green.

### Security & Compliance
- Dependabot configuration skeleton ensuring future automated security updates.
- Security policy and MIT license published.
- Dependency audit gating high severity vulnerabilities.

## Current Metrics (as of latest run)
- Version: 0.2.0 (clean-up branch for 0.2.1 prep).
- Test files: 4 | Tests: 6 | All passing.
- Coverage: Reported in PR summaries (exact % varies; badge reflects main after merge).
- Initial bundle (analyze mode) main JS ~613 kB (pre-splitting) – optimization target defined.

## Technical Deep Dives

### Auth Bootstrap Guard
StrictMode double mounting can re-trigger effects. A module-scope sentinel ensures `refresh()` executes only once, preventing redundant `/api/me` calls and noisy logs.

### Health Polling Resilience
The HealthCheckCard uses a mutable ref to store current status and interval ID, decoupling render cycles from scheduling. On consecutive failures it pauses; the Resume action triggers an immediate fetch then reinstates the interval, ensuring no silent stagnation.

### Release Safety
Running on non-`main` is blocked early (branch check) — eliminates accidental pre-release tags. The script validates `[Unreleased]` content before mutating versions, preventing half-applied releases.

### Dependency Audit Strategy
Runtime-only scope (`--omit=dev`) focuses signal. High/Critical block merges; Moderate/Low escalate via visibility only. Fallback remediation order keeps velocity while minimizing risk: update deps → overrides → patch-package → temporary allowlist (time-boxed) → forward-fix.

### Bundle Analysis & Budgeting
`analyze.mjs` captures the temporary stats.html path emitted by `vite-bundle-visualizer`, rehomes it to a stable `dist/bundle-stats.html`, and auto-opens. Soft budget (250 kB gzip) informs prioritization without blocking. Planned steps: route-level dynamic imports, vendor chunk isolation, and selective Chakra imports.

## Open / Next Focus Areas
- Performance: Implement route-based code-splitting; manualChunks for large vendors; evaluate lazy loading dev-only panels.
- Testing: Expand beyond smoke/auth flows — add logout, error boundary, health failure escalation edge cases.
- Observability: Lightweight event bus + console sink; future aggregation to remote telemetry.
- Accessibility: Systematic a11y pass (ARIA roles, focus management on route transitions).
- Dependency governance: Introduce optional audit-ci allowlist automation with expiration enforcement.

## Risk & Debt Overview
- Bundle size above soft target; no user-facing performance regressions yet (early stage), but scaling risk if features pile on pre-splitting.
- Limited test breadth around negative auth flows and UI animation toggles.
- No automated size regression gate yet (only manual analyze); risk of unnoticed growth.

## Recommendations (Short Term)
1. Implement initial route-level `React.lazy` splits for least critical pages.
2. Add a CI informational step measuring gzip size of main JS and posting to PR summary.
3. Add tests for logout and session-expiry re-auth path.
4. Introduce minimal event bus to standardize future telemetry instrumentation.
5. Prepare manualChunks config to isolate framer-motion + chakra to reduce initial load.

## Appendix: Key Scripts & Workflows
| Script | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `npm run release` | Version bump + changelog migration + tag (main-only guard). |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Vitest with V8 coverage provider; thresholds enforced. |
| `npm run analyze` | Build in analyze mode + produce stable bundle-stats report. |
| `npm run changelog:check` | Ensures changes include changelog entry. |

| Workflow | Function |

| Frontend CI | Lint, typecheck, tests, changelog check, build + artifacts. |
| Coverage Badge | PR coverage run + main badge update. |
| Dependency Audit | Fails on High/Critical vulnerabilities; summarizes severities. |
